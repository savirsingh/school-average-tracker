# School Average Tracker
School Average Tracker is a simple and open-source Python Tkinter application which stores and keeps record of your current grades and your current average in school or university. It will also give you feedback about how you're currently performing.

### It has a very simple user interface which you can use to store and keep track of (currently) up to 30 grades!
